# WeKan - WeKan Native

- Made with C89, SDL2, Nuklear GUI, SQLite.
- One executeable GUI binary, that saves files to wekan-files directory structure like Meteor 3 WeKan FerretDB SQLite
- All code compatible with MIT license. No GPL code.
- Newest dependencies, that does not have vulnerabilities.
- Drag drop, looks same like Meteor 3 WeKan.
- For all desktop and mobile operating systems.
- Based on Meteor 3 WeKan https://github.com/wekan/wekan/models
- Local mode: Uses local SQLite database for read and write
- Remote mode: Uses WeKan REST API with any Meteor 3 WeKan URL for read and write
- Import Export between local and remote
- Uses WeKan Jade UI layout, with Nuclear UI components

# Roadmap

- [x] Add GitHub Actions release-all.yml that crosscompiles for many operating systems
  - Added the target matrix, runner selection, per-target build-script contract,
    artifact upload, and a structural regression test. Targets remain pending until
    their cross-compilation scripts produce verified binaries.
- Operating systems at the beginning at release-all.yml:
  - [x] Linux arm64
    - Builds a strict C89 ARM64 ELF executable with GCC and verifies its ELF class
      and AArch64 machine header before artifact upload.
  - [x] Linux amd64
    - Builds a strict C89 x86-64 ELF executable with GCC and verifies its ELF class
      and AMD64 machine header before artifact upload.
  - [x] Linux armhf
    - Builds a strict C89 32-bit ARM hard-float ELF executable and verifies its
      ELF class, ARM machine header, and hard-float ABI flag before artifact upload.

- [_] Convert Meteor 3 schema to SQLite schema that is optimized for fast queries
- [_] Using Nuclear GUI components, create same UI layout
- [_] Import/Export from WeKan, Trello, etc via WeKan REST API, Trello API, etc
- [_] Nuclear GUI adapts to all screen sizes from smallest to biggest, with mobile and desktop mode, like Meteor 3 WeKan
- [_] GUI works with touch displays, mouse, keyboard
- [_] Possible to drag drop same way like Meteor 3 WeKan
- [_] Collapse Swimlane, List, Card etc like Meteor 3 WeKan
